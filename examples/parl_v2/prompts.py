"""Orchestrator system prompts for the three PARL v2 agent modes.

- ``ORCHESTRATOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT`` (swarm-strict): only ``create_subagent`` /
  ``assign_task`` available, so the Orchestrator must delegate to touch
  any data. Baseline for isolating delegation behavior.
- ``ORCHESTRATOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT_PAPER`` (swarm-paper): paper-faithful —
  Orchestrator gets direct ``search``/``access`` plus the subagent
  tools. No hand-coded heuristic about when to delegate vs call
  directly; the reward (r_parallel / r_finish / critical_steps budget)
  is expected to shape that trade-off during training.
- ``ORCHESTRATOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT_SINGLE`` (single-agent baseline): only
  direct ``search``/``access``, no delegation.

The sub-agent ``<result>…</result>`` output contract and the
must-tool-use requirement are NOT restated in these Orchestrator
prompts: ``assign_task.py:117`` already appends
``SUBAGENT_OUTPUT_SUFFIX`` (``tool.py:26``) and
``SUBAGENT_REACT_SUFFIX`` (``widesearch/subagent_prompts.py:21``) to
every sub-agent system prompt, so the sub-agent already sees them.

swarm-strict and swarm-paper do disclose: (a) the 8-unique-name
registry cap and the replace-on-reuse semantics (factual claim about
``tool.py::MAX_REGISTRY_SIZE`` and ``tool.py:111``); (b) the
sub-agent 10-tool-call + ~5000-char-per-access budget (Orchestrator
needs it for sub-task granularity planning). Keep those numbers in
sync whenever ``tool.py`` or ``widesearch/assign_task.py`` changes.

``run_parl_v2.py`` selects which constant to load via
``--orchestrator-prompt-path`` based on ``--agent-mode``.

    "specific system prompt describing its role and scope. Sub-agents inherit "
    "`search` and `access` over the local knowledge base and run their own ReAct "
    "loop — you do not need to describe the workflow or tools in the prompt you "
    "register. The registry holds up to 8 unique names; re-registering an existing "
    "name replaces its system prompt in place and does not count against the cap.\n"
    "- `assign_task`: Delegate a task to a created sub-agent. You can emit multiple "
    "`assign_task` calls in the same turn to dispatch sub-agents in parallel.\n\n"
    "# Sub-agent Budget\n"
    "Each sub-agent may issue at most 10 tool calls total (combined `search` + "
    "`access`), and each `access` returns at most ~5000 characters. Plan sub-task "
    "granularity with these limits in mind; split evidence-heavy work across "
    "multiple sub-agents in parallel when one sub-agent would exceed them.\n\n"
    "# Context Isolation\n"
    "Sub-agents do not share your context. They see only the `system_prompt` you "
    "register and the `prompt` you pass to `assign_task` — include any URLs, prior "
    "findings, or specific columns/fields they need in those fields. When a "
    "sub-agent finishes, you receive only the content of its `<result>\u2026</result>` "
