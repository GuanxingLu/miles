"""Subagent-side prompt + tool-spec bundle for the widesearch environment.

The orchestrator spawns subagents via ``assign_task``. Each subagent then
runs a multi-turn ReAct loop inside ``widesearch/assign_task.py`` with
``search`` and ``access`` tools pointed at the local RAG server. The
subagent's system prompt combines:

1. The ``system_prompt`` the orchestrator registered via ``create_subagent``.
2. ``SUBAGENT_REACT_SUFFIX`` below — ReAct-style instructions describing
   the two tools and the mandatory ``<result>…</result>`` output block.
3. ``SUBAGENT_OUTPUT_SUFFIX`` from root tool.py (already appended to (1)
   by the shared convention, but we explicitly add it here too so the
   subagent can't skip it).

The tool_specs are what SGLang's tool-call parser sees when it decodes
the subagent's response; names/parameters are kept close to RLinf's
wideseek_r1 tools.py so prompts can be reused.
